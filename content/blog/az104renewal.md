# Renewing my AZ104

Last August, I completed a very hard task: passing my Azure AZ-104 test and obtaining a very difficult certification. The problem is that Microsoft does not allow you to keep it forever, as you must renew it every single year. I wasn't planning on renewing this certification because sure, it was difficult, but that my opinion on certifications isn't super positive. That was until I found a blog article about someone renewing their certification. With the renewal, you are not proctored and can take it as many times as you want! This is awesome because it takes a lot of the load off of your shoulders. I may not have mentioned the physical stress and pain that studying for this exam caused me. Just the stress alone of cramming a certification in just two months caused two of my discs in my neck to pop out, pushing against a few nerves that resulted in numbness/tingling in the left arm, constant back aches and stiff neck muscles that were constantly in a spasm. Not fun, especially since I've had two spinal epidurals since last November.

So now it's time to get back at studying. It's time to get nerdy with notes, dedicate the time and just be all about Azure again.

I did take a practice test yesterday, and although I did horribly, a lot of things were brought back to mind and I even surprised myself on a few topics. I just think that it's going to take some time to get back in the swing of things, get my mind in the right place, and just obsess over it until I get it done.

What's next? It's onto the next certification . . . and then I'll have 2 to renew next year!
