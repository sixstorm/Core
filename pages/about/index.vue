      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Andrew - a Senior System Administrator with over 14 years of
        IT experience. I am a proud husband and father of 1, living in the
        southeast US.

        I am passionate about technology, specifically where it fits in my life,
        where it makes sense. I believe that not everything "fits" and therefore
        needs to be purged; finding the balance in this is crucial to our lives.
        I'm also passionate about staying organized, having processes, being
        productive, open source software, sharing data and knowledge, and
        coding.
      </p>

        Some tech things that I have done outside of my job are this site,
        automation with PowerShell and Python, running a home lab powered by
        Ubuntu Linux and Docker, and of course fixing tech things for my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is one of the few things that I do well, it just seems to
        click with me. I love to try new things, dabble in new tech, play video
        games, consume media, and write.
