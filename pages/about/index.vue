      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Andrew and this is my little corner of the net. I am a 14
        year IT vet who loves tech when it makes sense. I am also a proud
        husband and father of 1.

        Technology is one of the few things that I do well in this life. It just
        seems to click with me. I love to try new things, dabble in stuff that
        may or may not be worth the time and effort, all while only keeping
        things around that make sense. You can't force yourself to keep up with
        something that doesn't make sense.
